WEEK 2: JavaScript Fundamentals Part 2
Focus: Async JavaScript, Modules, ES6+ features

DAY 1 (Monday): Promises & Error Handling
Morning concepts:

What are Promises (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
.then() and .catch()
Chaining promises
try/catch with synchronous code
Promise.all() basics

Afternoon practice:

Build promise exercises (fetch simulation with timeouts)
Error handling scenarios
Chain multiple promises

Mini project:

Simple data fetcher (mock API with promises)


DAY 2 (Tuesday): async/await
Morning concepts:

async functions
await keyword
try/catch with async/await
Error handling in async functions
When to use promises vs async/await

Afternoon practice:

Convert Day 1 promise exercises to async/await
Multiple async operations
Error handling practice

Mini project:

Refactor yesterday's fetcher with async/await


DAY 3 (Wednesday): Fetch API + Real APIs
Morning concepts:

fetch() basics
Request/response objects
HTTP methods (GET, POST)
Headers and status codes
.json() method
Handling fetch errors

Afternoon practice:

Fetch from real free APIs (JSONPlaceholder, OpenWeather)
Handle loading states
Handle errors (network, 404, etc.)

Start main project:

Weather App - Basic structure, fetch weather data, display it


DAY 4 (Thursday): ES6+ Features Part 1
Morning concepts:

Spread operator (...) with arrays and objects
Rest parameters (...args)
Optional chaining (?.)
Nullish coalescing (??)

Afternoon practice:

Exercises using each operator
Refactor old code with new syntax
Combine operators in real scenarios

Continue project:

Weather App - Add features using ES6+ (default values, optional chaining for API data)


DAY 5 (Friday): ES6 Modules
Morning concepts:

import and export
Named exports vs default exports
Importing multiple things
Module scope
Organizing code into modules

Afternoon practice:

Split code into modules
Import/export exercises
File structure best practices

Continue project:

Weather App - Refactor into modules (api.js, ui.js, utils.js, app.js)


DAY 6 (Saturday): Git Branching + Project Polish
Morning:

Git branching basics (git branch, git checkout, git switch)
Creating feature branches
Merging branches
Resolving basic merge conflicts
Pull request workflow (on GitHub)

Afternoon:

Weather App - Polish and complete:

Error handling (city not found, network error)
Loading states
Better UI
localStorage (save last searched city)
Deploy to Netlify/Vercel



Git practice:

Create feature branch for each new feature
Merge back to main
Push to GitHub
Practice PR workflow (even if it's just you)


DAY 7 (Sunday): Review + Bonus Project
Morning review:

Quick quiz on Week 2 concepts (ask ChatGPT)
Review anything confusing
Practice weak areas

Afternoon (optional):

Bonus project idea:

Movie search app (OMDB API)
Recipe finder (TheMealDB API)
GitHub user search (GitHub API)
Currency converter


Or catch up if you're behind

Weekly reflection:

What did you learn?
What was hardest?
Are you ready for Week 3 (CSS)?


KEY DELIVERABLES BY END OF WEEK 2:
✅ Weather app (fully functional, deployed, modular)
✅ GitHub repo with branches and commits
✅ Understanding of async JavaScript
✅ Comfortable with fetch API
✅ Using ES6+ features naturally
✅ Basic Git workflow (branch, merge, PR)


TIPS FOR THIS WEEK:

Don't rush promises and async/await (Days 1-2) - These are foundational. Make sure you REALLY understand them.
Use real APIs early (Day 3+) - Dealing with real data is different than mock data. You'll face real errors, weird responses, etc.
Git practice matters - Don't skip Day 6 Git practice. You'll use this workflow forever.
Weather app is your main focus - Start it Day 3, improve it Days 4-5, polish it Day 6. This goes in your portfolio.
APIs to use:

OpenWeatherMap (weather data - free tier)
JSONPlaceholder (practice API)
Dog CEO (dog images - fun for practice)
PokéAPI (Pokémon data - good for practice)


Deploy early - Deploy the weather app even when it's basic. Then keep improving it. Learn deployment early.
